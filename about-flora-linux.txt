This is a project to develop Linux distribution based upon Debian and MX Linux.
In short, it is a hybrid re-spin ISO of Debian stabe and MX.
I have adopted a picture of flowers as Desktop wallpaper on the last release, that is why it is named Flora Linux.

There is no source-level modification, because I think it important to end-users that this distribution should completelty compatible with upsream distribution such as Debian and MX Linux. 

After all, this is a derivative of Debian and MX for end users of Linux Desktop.
